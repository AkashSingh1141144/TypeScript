## 🛠 Purpose

This repository is **not a project** — it's a **learning log**, built as I explore TypeScript deeply.  
Think of it as my digital notebook, but a bit more organized and a lot more typed. 😄

---

## ✨ Goal

Master TypeScript fundamentals and build strong confidence for real-world projects — one file at a time.
