// Null DataType in TypeScript
// //   The null data type is used to represent the intentional absence of any object value. It is a primitive data type in TypeScript and can be assigned to variables that are explicitly meant to have no value. In TypeScript, null is a subtype of all other types, meaning you can assign null to any variable type.
var nullVariable = null;
console.log(nullVariable); // Output: null
