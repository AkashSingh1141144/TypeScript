// Undefined DataType in TypeScript

// // The undefined data type is used to represent a variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. In TypeScript, undefined is a subtype of all other types, meaning you can assign undefined to any variable type. It is often used to indicate that a variable is intentionally left uninitialized or that a function does not return a value.

const undefinedVariable: undefined = undefined;
console.log(undefinedVariable); 




let userNameIsUndefined: string | undefined = undefined; 
userNameIsUndefined = "Akash";
console.log(userNameIsUndefined); // Output: Akash




let str : string;
console.log(str);
