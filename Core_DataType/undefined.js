// Undefined DataType in TypeScript
// // The undefined data type is used to represent a variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. In TypeScript, undefined is a subtype of all other types, meaning you can assign undefined to any variable type. It is often used to indicate that a variable is intentionally left uninitialized or that a function does not return a value.
var undefinedVariable = undefined;
console.log(undefinedVariable);
var userNameIsUndefined = undefined;
userNameIsUndefined = "Akash";
console.log(userNameIsUndefined); // Output: Akash
var str;
console.log(str);
