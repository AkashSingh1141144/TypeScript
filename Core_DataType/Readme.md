// a data type classifies the kind of value a variable can hold. It enables static typing, which means that the type of a variable is checked during compilation, helping to catch errors early in the development process. TypeScript offers several built-in data types
// 1. Number
// 2. String
// 3. Boolean
// 4. Array
// 5. Tuple
// 6. Enum
// 7. Any
// 8. Void
// 9. Null
// 10. Undefined
// 11. Never
// 12. Object

// 1. Number
// The number data type represents both integer and floating-point numbers. It can be used to perform arithmetic operations and mathematical calculations.

// 2. String
// The string data type represents a sequence of characters. It can be used to store and manipulate text data, such as names, addresses, and messages.

// 3. Boolean
// The boolean data type represents a value that can be either true or false. It is commonly used in conditional statements and loops to control the flow of execution.

// 4. Array					// The array data type represents a collection of elements of the same type. It can be used to store and manipulate a list of items, such as numbers, strings, or objects.
Use the type followed by square brackets ([])

// 5. Tuple
// The tuple data type represents an ordered collection of elements of different types. It can be used to store and manipulate a fixed-size collection of values, such as a date with a year, month, and day.

// 6. Enum
// The enum data type represents a set of named values. It can be used to define a collection of related constants, such as days of the week or colors.

// 7. Any
// The any data type represents a value of any type. It can be used to bypass type checking and allow variables to hold values of different types.

// 8. Void					// The void data type represents the absence of a value. It can be used to indicate that a function does not return a value.

// 9. Null
// The null data type represents the intentional absence of any object value. It can be used to indicate that a variable has no value.

// 10. Undefined	// The undefined data type represents the absence of any value. It can be used to indicate that a variable has not been assigned a value.

// 11. Never
// The never data type represents a value that is never actually reached. It can be used to indicate that a function will never return a value.

// 12. Object
// The object data type represents a collection of properties and methods. It can be used to store and manipulate complex data structures, such as objects, arrays, and functions.
